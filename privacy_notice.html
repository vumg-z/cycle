        The revocation of consent for information handling will proceed when requested and when you prove to be the data
        subject and it is legally viable to proceed with it. If there is a current contractual relationship or a pending
        obligation to fulfill, the revocation will be subject to the contract that gave rise to the legal relationship,
        in accordance with the provisions of sections 16, subsection II of the Law, 14, 21, 30, 40, 41, and 42 of the
        Regulation.

        The revocation of your consent can be carried out after 5 (five) natural days have passed from the date you were
        given the opportunity to express your refusal to data processing. You can request the revocation at the address
        provided in the "Addressing Questions and Complaints" section by submitting a written request that expressly
        mentions your name and the following statement: "Through this written document, I (data subject's name) request
        that the legal entity 'REDCYCLE' revoke my consent for the processing of my personal data." Include the reason
        for the revocation, the approximate date on which the personal data was transmitted, the legal or commercial
        relationship that exists or existed with the company, your email address or mailing address to notify you of the
        response to your request, the date of the request, your handwritten signature, and a copy of your official
        identification. All these requirements are requested to ensure that the request is issued in a verifiable manner
        concerning the data subject or requester.

        <br> <br> <span class="text-red-600"> Exclusion List.

        "REDCYCLE" will have an exclusion list of information, in which all
        information that the data subject wishes to be excluded from information processing will be placed and stored.
        To proceed with such storage, it is necessary for you to submit a written request in which you expressly mention
        your name and the statement "I, (data subject's name), through this letter, request from the legal entity
        "REDCYCLE" the exclusion of my information related to: (list or specify what type of data and information you
        wish to exclude from our processing) regarding the processing of my personal data," the approximate date when
        the personal data were transmitted, the legal or commercial relationship that exists or existed with the
        company, your email address or address to notify you of the response to your request, the date of the request,
        handwritten signature, and a copy of your official identification.

        We inform you that even if you exclude or revoke consent for information processing, it is our obligation to
        retain all data, when it concerns accounting information for 5 to 10 years as provided in the Federal Fiscal
        Code in Article 30, and in the case of commercial information, for 10 years as provided in Article 46 of the
        Commercial Code. After that time period, the information may be deleted and completely destroyed.
